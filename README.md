# Next.js Firebase To-Do App

This is a web application built with Next.js that leverages Firebase for authentication and Firestore for storing and managing to-do items. With this app, you can create, read, update, and delete to-do items seamlessly. It's a great example of how to combine Next.js with Firebase for a full-stack web development project.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-firebase-todo-app.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd nextjs-firebase-todo-app
    ```

3. **Install the project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

4. **Configure Firebase:**

    - Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Generate your Firebase configuration object for web apps.
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add your Firebase configuration:

        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
        ```

        Replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, `YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, and `YOUR_APP_ID` with your Firebase project's credentials.

5. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

6. **Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.**

## Features

- **Authentication**: Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out using Firebase Authentication.

- **To-Do Management**: Create, read, update, and delete to-do items in real-time using Firebase Firestore.

- **Real-time Updates**: Any changes to the to-do list are instantly reflected across all connected devices.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows the conventions of a typical Next.js application:

- **pages**: Contains the Next.js pages, including the authentication pages (login, signup, and logout) and the main to-do list page.

- **components**: Reusable UI components used throughout the application.

- **lib**: Firebase configuration and utility functions.

- **styles**: Styling for the application, including Tailwind CSS classes.

- **public**: Static assets such as images and fonts.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel platform from the creators of Next.js. Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

**Note**: Don't forget to set up Firebase authentication and Firestore rules for production use and ensure your Firebase configuration is properly secured.
